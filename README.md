# arch
1: scripts to pull all packages and their configs after a fresh arch install and install them along with their config files

there are two files: root.sh and user.sh, execute root.sh as root user, and execute user.sh as a regular user.

2: personal versions of dwm and st which you can compile and run, but make sure to take a look at the configs and the autostart files.
