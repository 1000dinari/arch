T 1561028786 20<hazaardinari>30	and that's it?
T 1561028810 19<HEX0>	hazaardinari: yeah. just recommend reading PKGBUILD if you don't want to end up with a crypto miner installed
T 1561028812 20<hazaardinari>30	hey but i have to put all the url's for the packages
T 1561028813 18<jamespharvey2018>	only other trouble really is if AUR packages depend on other AUR packages, it won't recursively grab the dependencies for you, you have to do them one by one
T 1561028832 20<hazaardinari>30	isnt that.... cumbersome
T 1561028853 18<jamespharvey2018>	yes, but it's always https://aur.archlinux.org/<pkgname>.git so you can script it
T 1561028859 18<copypaste18>	jamespharvey20: i maintain `ocrmypdf` on AUR and i actually recommend you install it with an AUR helper for that reason
T 1561028863 18<copypaste18>	it relies on like 40 packages
T 1561028865 20<hazaardinari>30	i mean i get why arch is minimal, but grabbing deps on your own is just being minimal to look cool
T 1561028870 18<copypaste18>	(recursively, all told)
T 1561028878 18<copypaste18>	and most of those are AUR

T 1561028888 19<earnestly>	hazaardinari: Because the contents of the AUR are not supported
T 1561028889 19<Hellsenberg>	hazaardinari: resolving the dependency tree is VERY cumbersome, but once you have it you just need to flatten it into a list of package names, and install them one by one (it's a 'for each' loop) 
T 1561028922 18<jamespharvey2018>	most AUR packages that I've ran into anyway don't have AUR deps, or if they do it's like 1-2.
T 1561028922 19<HEX0>	hazaardinari: not really. I have 7 AUR packages installed currently. doesn't take much effort to resolve a few dependencies manually
T 1561028934 19<Hellsenberg>	hazaardinari: oh, and you would need to make sure that you install dependencies with "--asdeps" (or whatever the option is)
T 1561028934 20<hazaardinari>30	so i need a script for all the aur packages, then a script for their sependancies, long with noting down all url's
T 1561028951 18<Hellsenberg18>	you don't "need" a script
