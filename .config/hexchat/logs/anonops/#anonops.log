Jun 27 23:34:44 <tripz>	heya bmshell 
Jun 27 23:34:47 <tripz>	hows it going today
Jun 27 23:34:55 <Sebbie>	windows7: Windows 10 is much better as you know
Jun 27 23:35:32 <windows7>	windows 10 is better than windows 10?
Jun 27 23:35:32 <lazarus>	humm!
Jun 27 23:35:39 <windows7>	7*
Jun 27 23:35:58 *	Ninja installs Linux on windows7 
Jun 27 23:36:08 <windows7>	i dont know what you're smoking mate
Jun 27 23:36:12 <Sebbie>	yes windows 10 is million times better than 7
Jun 27 23:36:20 <windows7>	half the world is running windows 7
Jun 27 23:36:35 <windows7>	just the wretched update thing caused me to switch
Jun 27 23:36:43 <windows7>	and windows 7 is extremely stable
Jun 27 23:36:44 <Ninja>	how about Linux?
Jun 27 23:36:54 <V-Senpai>	how do you quantify that million?
Jun 27 23:37:00 <Sebbie>	I think forced updates are good because of all idiots pressing "Dismiss" on the updates
Jun 27 23:37:10 <windows7>	linux outdoes every windows i dont think you need to say that
Jun 27 23:37:23 <windows7>	huh
Jun 27 23:37:32 <windows7>	i need to smoke what you're smoking
Jun 27 23:37:34 <Ninja>	.vend windows7 
Jun 27 23:37:36 *	Effexor vends windows7 a bag of SunChips.
Jun 27 23:37:38 <bl00per>	Depends windows7
Jun 27 23:37:54 <bl00per>	If you are a gamer you would opt for windows
Jun 27 23:37:58 <windows7>	also those nsa backdoors....
Jun 27 23:38:07 <windows7>	bl00per, not really
Jun 27 23:38:19 <Sebbie>	windows7: Why would I need to smoke anything? I mean, most computer users, when faced with updates, just press "Later", "Not now" instead of taking the update. Thats why forced updates with forced reboots are good.
Jun 27 23:38:19 <windows7>	manjaro with steam and proton
Jun 27 23:38:48 <windows7>	not really, a user should have the freedom to chose
Jun 27 23:38:54 <Ninja>	How about Ubuntu, not bad huh?
Jun 27 23:39:06 <windows7>	i loved ubuntu till the amazon scandal
Jun 27 23:39:23 <Sebbie>	windows7: A badly updated system isn't only a harm of the user, its harm to everyone of the internet with unpatched systems spreading ransomware and malware
Jun 27 23:39:24 <v1>	Forced updates go against the users
Jun 27 23:39:27 <windows7>	after that i ditched ubuntu and ubuntu based distros for personal use
Jun 27 23:39:52 <windows7>	you wanna talk malware?
Jun 27 23:39:58 <windows7>	why even use windows then
Jun 27 23:40:20 <windows7>	i can't see why a regular user wont use mint or fedora
Jun 27 23:40:27 <windows7>	or debian stable
Jun 27 23:40:33 *	Ninja has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Jun 27 23:40:34 <Sebbie>	Also another thing with badly updated systems are that the break the compatiblity of the internet, if half of the internet are running something else.
Jun 27 23:40:51 <Sebbie>	if everyone could run something similiar, life would be easier for web developers and coders
Jun 27 23:40:55 <windows7>	compatibility of the interwhat?
Jun 27 23:40:58 <v1>	Like linux
Jun 27 23:41:07 <windows7>	lulz
Jun 27 23:41:12 <sklv>	wtf the interoperability is what literally enables the internet
Jun 27 23:41:15 <sklv>	monoculture sucks
Jun 27 23:41:25 <windows7>	you remember the apple commercial
Jun 27 23:41:31 <windows7>	the hammer and the clones
Jun 27 23:42:05 <windows7>	i have never met a windows fanboy well hello
Jun 27 23:42:05 <Sebbie>	v1: I know that you want users choice, but don't you think updates are good for everyone? I don't see why such a rage outbreaked when Microsoft had forced updates. Its so weird that people can become angry of that their computers become better with time
Jun 27 23:42:20 *	zippy has quit (Connection closed)
Jun 27 23:42:21 <windows7>	better?
Jun 27 23:42:32 <windows7>	better how?
Jun 27 23:42:51 <Sebbie>	yes each update, especially the 6 month feature updates, greatly improve their computes by a magnitude
Jun 27 23:42:53 <sklv>	that's disingenious. people become angry that they're forced to stop what they're doing
Jun 27 23:42:57 <windows7>	the entire internet is hosted on linux
Jun 27 23:43:05 <sklv>	uhhhh
Jun 27 23:43:11 <windows7>	trolling i see
Jun 27 23:43:29 <bl00per>	hmm you cant say that the internet is hosted on linux
Jun 27 23:43:32 <windows7>	windows writes sloppy useless code
Jun 27 23:43:34 <Sebbie>	windows7: yeah agree. Linux is good on server systems, embedded systems and kiosks. But I personally think that Windows is better for general purpose computers
Jun 27 23:43:42 <bl00per>	internet is just a huge group of pcs
Jun 27 23:43:47 <windows7>	no, linux is better in ever regard
Jun 27 23:44:10 <bmshell>	.penis windows7
Jun 27 23:44:11 <Effexor>	bmshell: 8::::::::::::::D - - - - *windows7's face*.
Jun 27 23:44:12 <bl00per>	from the perspective of a gamer it isnt since most games are not compatible
Jun 27 23:44:17 <windows7>	bl00per, netflix hosts their shit on linux, that's gotta be a huge chunk right there
Jun 27 23:44:22 <bmshell>	even though i use windows7
Jun 27 23:44:29 <sopi>	that's changing with proton
Jun 27 23:44:33 *	You are now known as arch-btw
Jun 27 23:44:34 <Sebbie>	like, you don't use a tanker truck to drive to the job and home again. But a tanker truck is good to transport large amounts of liquid, like a bus is good to transport large amounts of people. In same way, linux is suitable for a subset of tasks. Windows is like a personal car.
Jun 27 23:44:36 <bl00per>	I also think linux is neat but you cant compare them
Jun 27 23:44:48 <bl00per>	its the same as comparing a hammer and a screw
Jun 27 23:44:59 <bl00per>	they are both doing their job
Jun 27 23:45:00 <arch-btw>	well it depends which distro
Jun 27 23:45:07 <arch-btw>	linux is just a kernel
Jun 27 23:45:10 <sopi>	valve is doing a very good job for supporting games on linux
Jun 27 23:45:24 <sopi>	ehm, gnu/linux*
Jun 27 23:45:35 <arch-btw>	i'll talk to you in 2024 when there will be gnu/linux only games
Jun 27 23:45:45 <sopi>	^ <3
Jun 27 23:45:49 <arch-btw>	windows is the shittiest os
Jun 27 23:45:55 <bl00per>	until then, both are good
Jun 27 23:46:02 <Sebbie>	arch-btw: I know, but I know no distro that currently beats windows in hardware compatiblity and general compatiblity with DRM for example Microsoft DRM
Jun 27 23:46:03 <arch-btw>	even mac is better because its a unix derivative
Jun 27 23:46:27 <sopi>	fuck DRM
Jun 27 23:46:30 <Sebbie>	I have for example a water cooling loop in my computer whose USB controller is ONLY compatible with Windows
Jun 27 23:46:36 <arch-btw>	drm is an anti feature
Jun 27 23:47:03 <Sebbie>	with DRM I mean support for DRM, not DRM as feature itself. Support for DRM = you can open protected files like music files you bought.
Jun 27 23:47:14 <sopi>	Sebbie: you should listen to our lord saviour Richard Stallman
Jun 27 23:47:29 <sopi>	aka the holy Ignucius
