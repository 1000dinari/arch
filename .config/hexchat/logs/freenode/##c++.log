Jun 21 13:48:25 <hazaardinari>	please help
Jun 21 13:48:50 <RandomReader>	hazaardinari - you need to methodically learn C++ from basics, not attempt to jump into it like it's another language
Jun 21 13:48:58 <RandomReader>	!basics
Jun 21 13:48:59 <nolyc>	Books, references, tutorials, for all levels of learning: http://isocpp.org/get-started ; https://isocpp.org/faq ; http://www.dev-hq.net/c++/ ; http://learncpp.com/ ; http://stackoverflow.com/q/388242 ; https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines ; http://cppreference.com/
Jun 21 13:49:09 <hazaardinari>	i've done a 2 year course
Jun 21 13:49:13 <RandomReader>	strongly recommend the book list from the stackoverflow link
Jun 21 13:49:17 <hazaardinari>	i was revising
Jun 21 13:49:29 *	queip (~queip@unaffiliated/rezurus) has joined
Jun 21 13:49:34 <RandomReader>	then use one of the faster books like Tour, but either way you need to revisit the basics :)
Jun 21 13:49:48 <hazaardinari>	my strings are very weak
Jun 21 13:50:04 <hazaardinari>	because there's just so many programs
Jun 21 13:50:30 <hazaardinari>	there's more than 4 ways to do a single opration
Jun 21 13:50:37 <hazaardinari>	for strings

Jun 21 13:53:10 <RandomReader>	sigh
Jun 21 13:53:21 <hazaardinari>	?
Jun 21 13:53:34 <RandomReader>	no offense meant here, but dude: stop trying to take shortcuts, this seems to be your entire problem here
Jun 21 13:53:36 *	pa (~pa@unaffiliated/pa) has joined
Jun 21 13:53:43 <hazaardinari>	its a tour of c++
Jun 21 13:53:55 <RandomReader>	if you can't slow down and approach your problem with care, you will *never* be able to effectively use C++
Jun 21 13:53:57 <hazaardinari>	by the writer of c++
Jun 21 13:54:16 <RandomReader>	if you want a faster-to-work-with language, you should use one, C++ is not that
Jun 21 13:54:20 <Kman>	without defining default constructor,  how to use this kind of class as function parameter?  as the error: no matching function for call to 'T::T()'
Jun 21 13:54:24 <hazaardinari>	this is book 1 in the list you gave me
Jun 21 13:54:45 <RandomReader>	and right now this is extending to not even bothering to look at the links I provided, because you've linked to an illegal copy of an older version of the book that's already available for free at one of the links I provided!
Jun 21 13:54:55 <ville>	!ive Kman testcase
Jun 21 13:54:57 <Svitkona>	Kman, you... just do it

Jun 21 13:55:05 <Svitkona>	what are you trying to do?
Jun 21 13:55:05 <ville>	!give Kman testcase
Jun 21 13:55:07 <nolyc>	Kman: A testcase is the _least_ amount of code that replicates your problem, paste it to https://wandbox.org/ press share and give us the URL. You _must_ use that website. Do _not_ use a different website. Do _not_ paste code to the channel. See the testcase checklist at http://eel.is/iso-c++/testcase/
