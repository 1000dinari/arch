Jun 20 16:05:53 <frenda>	az_IR.UTF-8 !!!
Jun 20 16:06:02 <hazaardinari>	Tom^, i installed wps office, they warned me about some fonts not working, this page was linked in that dialog box
Jun 20 16:06:10 <Tom^>	frenda: is LANG set to that in /etc/locale.conf ?
Jun 20 16:07:12 <HEX0>	hazaardinari: you could download them if you want pretty fonts, or not if pacman takes a while to update font cache. there's google translate aswell on chromium, probably extensions for firefox too
Jun 20 16:07:23 <frenda>	Tom^: /etc/locale.conf contents: line1: LANG=en_US.UTF-8, line2: LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8
Jun 20 16:07:52 <Tom^>	cool, then the digging commences. somewhere something sets LANG to az_IR :p
Jun 20 16:08:01 <frenda>	How can I remove "az_IR.UTF-8" from http://ix.io/1Mi0 ?

Jun 20 16:28:49 <hazaardinari>	is it better to install all packages via yay, or install repo packages with pacman and use yay for only aur
Jun 20 16:29:21 <Hellsenberg>	hazaardinari: aur helpers are not supported.
Jun 20 16:29:31 *	IceFoxX has quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
Jun 20 16:29:42 <jamespharvey20>	better to install all official packages with pacman, then use makepkg/devtools for aur, then either using pacman -U or setting up local repo
Jun 20 16:29:54 *	klardotsh has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.5)
Jun 20 16:30:03 <hazaardinari>	i'm too young for makepkg
Jun 20 16:31:06 <copypaste>	too young?
Jun 20 16:31:07 <jamespharvey20>	hrm, i think age might be a better excuse if you were saying you were too old for makepkg.  age is generally inversely proportional to learning technology, if anything.
Jun 20 16:31:08 <copypaste>	are you joking?
Jun 20 16:31:10 <copypaste>	get out of here
Jun 20 16:31:13 <Hellsenberg>	hazaardinari: if you don't know how to makepkg, then you shouldn't be using the AUR.
Jun 20 16:31:15 <copypaste>	stop trolling
Jun 20 16:31:57 <copypaste>	nobody is too good for `makepkg`. if you're too good for makepkg, you're too good for arch linux, or at least the AUR; go use another distro lol

Jun 20 16:35:35 <hazaardinari>	how long does it take to learn makepkg?
Jun 20 16:36:10 <jamespharvey20>	not long at all, seriously
Jun 20 16:36:17 <HEX0>	hazaardinari: $git clone URL $makepkg -sri
Jun 20 16:36:26 <hazaardinari>	and that's it?
Jun 20 16:36:50 <HEX0>	hazaardinari: yeah. just recommend reading PKGBUILD if you don't want to end up with a crypto miner installed
Jun 20 16:36:52 <hazaardinari>	hey but i have to put all the url's for the packages
Jun 20 16:36:53 <jamespharvey20>	only other trouble really is if AUR packages depend on other AUR packages, it won't recursively grab the dependencies for you, you have to do them one by one
Jun 20 16:37:12 <hazaardinari>	isnt that.... cumbersome
Jun 20 16:37:33 <jamespharvey20>	yes, but it's always https://aur.archlinux.org/<pkgname>.git so you can script it
Jun 20 16:37:39 <copypaste>	jamespharvey20: i maintain `ocrmypdf` on AUR and i actually recommend you install it with an AUR helper for that reason
Jun 20 16:37:43 <copypaste>	it relies on like 40 packages
Jun 20 16:37:45 <hazaardinari>	i mean i get why arch is minimal, but grabbing deps on your own is just being minimal to look cool
Jun 20 16:37:50 <copypaste>	(recursively, all told)
Jun 20 16:37:58 <copypaste>	and most of those are AUR
Jun 20 16:38:05 <jamespharvey20>	copypaste: yeah, situations like that do suck...
Jun 20 16:38:08 <earnestly>	hazaardinari: Because the contents of the AUR are not supported
Jun 20 16:38:09 <Hellsenberg>	hazaardinari: resolving the dependency tree is VERY cumbersome, but once you have it you just need to flatten it into a list of package names, and install them one by one (it's a 'for each' loop) 
Jun 20 16:38:42 <jamespharvey20>	most AUR packages that I've ran into anyway don't have AUR deps, or if they do it's like 1-2.
Jun 20 16:38:42 <HEX0>	hazaardinari: not really. I have 7 AUR packages installed currently. doesn't take much effort to resolve a few dependencies manually
Jun 20 16:38:54 <Hellsenberg>	hazaardinari: oh, and you would need to make sure that you install dependencies with "--asdeps" (or whatever the option is)
Jun 20 16:38:54 <hazaardinari>	so i need a script for all the aur packages, then a script for their sependancies, long with noting down all url's
Jun 20 16:39:11 <Hellsenberg>	you don't "need" a script
Jun 20 16:39:12 <copypaste>	when the next fontforge release comes out i think one of my AUR packages is going to be promoted :3
Jun 20 16:39:18 <Hellsenberg>	it does help, but it's not a requirement.
Jun 20 16:39:18 <jamespharvey20>	there was a set of packages that had a web of interdependencies, but upstream merged most of it into 1
Jun 20 16:39:21 <copypaste>	because we (fontforge devs) added a new dep
Jun 20 16:39:39 *	hazaardinari is gonna fucking stick with yay
Jun 20 16:39:56 <copypaste>	good luck
Jun 20 16:40:03 <copypaste>	enjoy breaking your installation and not knowing why
Jun 20 16:40:08 <copypaste>	enjoy the crypto miners also lol
Jun 20 16:40:20 <HEX0>	hazaardinari: you should give makepkg a chance before writing if off, based on some fucking guys on the internet telling you not to

Jun 20 16:47:53 <jelle>	oooof
Jun 20 16:47:57 <earnestly>	jelle: It's just that they don't let packages define them

Jun 20 16:48:08 <earnestly>	The bad part is why are they using C to do this

Jun 20 16:54:53 <earnestly>	Foxboron: The line count doesn't matter, the domain does
Jun 20 16:55:02 <HEX0>	I always wondered if using plain dash would be too painful for such things. seeing as debian uses that by default and bash can be a few times slower in some cases
Jun 20 16:55:03 <earnestly>	That said, makepkg could be more sh than bash
Jun 20 16:55:11 <amcrae>	Foxboron: yes - but libmakepkg scripts are all small

Jun 20 16:56:22 <earnestly>	amcrae: I'd have to review the entire thing, and how more of the filesystem and tools like grep can be used instead of things like arrays
Jun 20 16:56:31 <jamespharvey20>	hazaardinari: afaik i don't think there's a way to tell beyond that, other than killing things until it gets better.
Jun 20 16:56:34 <copypaste>	hazaardinari: probably all of those crypto miners from your refusal to understand arch at a deeper level
Jun 20 16:56:34 <svito>	hazaardinari: I see now, you should turn off your computer to solve this problem.

Jun 20 16:57:47 <earnestly>	That is a script to build a package can be done in not much more lines than a PKGBUILD, including doing various sanity checks
Jun 20 16:57:50 <amcrae>	earnestly: makepkg does lots more than what is in that gist

Jun 20 16:58:15 <hazaardinari>	you havent heard of wps offince?
Jun 20 16:58:18 <earnestly>	amcrae: Also yeah, using a directory under /tmp as a namespace and plying the filesystem to act as data structuring
Jun 20 16:58:30 <earnestly>	And then using ordinary tools that deal with files to manipulate them
Jun 20 16:58:49 <earnestly>	amcrae: I know, the solib stuff, stripping, etc

Jun 20 23:09:37 <grazzolini>	WinterStar: grub has it's own luks implementation. it doesn't use cryptsetup at all
Jun 20 23:09:43 <elibrokeit>	WinterStar: the command is "cryptomount", because grub isn't a linux program reading /usr/bin/cryptsetup

Jun 20 23:11:36 <hazaardinari>	so do i need to reboot for the new sudoers file to take effect?
Jun 20 23:11:38 <elibrokeit>	It's possible to do it from the initramfs but that is a booted Linux system
Jun 20 23:11:45 <Hellsenberg>	hazaardinari: how do you edit sudoers?

Jun 20 23:12:00 <Hellsenberg>	okay
Jun 20 23:12:12 <Hellsenberg>	you don't need to reboot, the file is read when running sudo
Jun 20 23:12:17 <hazaardinari>	right
Jun 20 23:12:23 <Hellsenberg>	hazaardinari: if you don't care much, you could make the "mount" and "umount" commands exceptions, so that sudo doesn't ask for a password for these commands for your user
Jun 20 23:12:56 <hazaardinari>	yeah but i have a lot of commands i wanna run without a password everytime
Jun 20 23:13:10 <grazzolini>	WinterStar: I seriously doubt it

Jun 21 14:30:10 <yvyz>	bug2000: ya, but you get used to using the r3 and r5 rules after a while. Honestly it changes how you approach objects and polymorphism.

Jun 21 14:30:46 <yvyz>	Boost is useful if you are writing a program that performs functions you do not understand or care to understand and you just want to it perform well for your boss who is paying you.

Jun 27 22:52:12 <hazaardinari>	but i3 is bloat

Jun 28 21:00:02 <Namarrgon>	if /boot isn't mounted then pacman writes the new kernel to /boot, while your bootloader loads the old version from your ESP
Jun 28 21:00:11 <hazaardinari>	fc-match shows DejaVuSansMono.ttf: "DejaVu Sans Mono" "Book"
Jun 28 21:00:23 <tairkarc>	so, I know how to restore the system, but is there a way to just downgrade the kernel and then reupgrade just the kernel with ESP mounted, would probably be faster than the other method
Jun 28 21:00:39 <Namarrgon>	tairkarc: if you boot the old kernel it can't load any of the modules because they were replaced with the new versions
